# d2b

A reusable d3-based chart library.

d2b is currently at pre-release state 0.x.x. It will remain here while I finish testing the library and putting together the API references. The source code is currently stable and other then some logic cleaning won't change much before the the first major release 1.0.0. Stay tuned for more information about the official release.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d2b`. Otherwise you can download the latest build [here](https://github.com/d2bjs/d2b). CDN coming soon.

## API Reference

You can see the d2b API references [here](http://docs.d2bjs.org).

## Examples

You can try out many d2b examples [here](http://d2bjs.org).
