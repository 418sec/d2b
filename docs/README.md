## What is it?

A d3-based reusable charting library.

## Why use it?

There are several reasons to use d2b over other charting frameworks. Here are some of them:

* It is built using the same module design as d3.js.
* Easy to start using if you already know d3 and a great place to start if you'd like to learn more about d3.
* Uses rollup.js as a bundler, which enables tree shaking and custom builds.
* Although it uses a similar implementation pattern as d3, it's purpose is to give you a suite of charts to use out of the box.  
* The module design pattern exposes internal d2b and d3 components that can be reconfigured to fit your needs.
* It comes with optional Vue.js components for rendering reactive charts.
